## ✨ Features

### 🎥 Algorithm Visualizer

- Visualizes 5 classic sorting algorithms:

  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort

- Animates sorting in real time with color-coded bars and value transitions.
- Control the **speed** of animations.
- Change the **array size** dynamically.

### 🏁 Race Mode

- Let multiple algorithms **race side-by-side** on the same array.
- Visually compare which algorithm performs best in real-time.
- Designed to make time complexity comparisons **fun and competitive**.

  ### Game Mode (in development)

  - A user can select the "Game Mode" tab under the respective sorting visualizer link.
  - It allows the user to manually swap the bars in adherance to the actual swaps performed by the algorithm.
  - The user gains/looses points based on correct/incorrect swaps.
  - Currently implemented for Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort and Selection Sort.

### 📚 Learn Alongside

- Time & Space complexity details.
- Short description and **fun historical trivia** about each algorithm.
- Syntax-highlighted code shown for each sorting algorithm.
