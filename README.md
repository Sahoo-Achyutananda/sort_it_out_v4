# SORT IT OUT – Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

**Sort It Out** is an interactive and engaging sorting algorithm visualizer built with **React**. Whether you're a student learning algorithms or a curious coder who enjoys visual interactivity, this tool makes complex sorting concepts simple, fun, and intuitive.


## ✨ Features

### Algorithm Visualizer

- Visualizes 5 classic sorting algorithms:

  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort

- Animates sorting in real time with color-coded bars and value transitions.
- Control the **speed** of animations.
- Change the **array size** dynamically.

### Race Mode

- Let multiple algorithms **race side-by-side** on the same array.
- Visually compare which algorithm performs best in real-time.
- Designed to make time complexity comparisons **fun and competitive**.

### Game Mode (in development)

- A user can select the "Game Mode" tab under the respective sorting visualizer link.
- It allows the user to manually swap the bars in adherance to the actual swaps performed by the algorithm.
- The user gains/looses points based on correct/incorrect swaps.
- Currently implemented for Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort and Selection Sort.

### Learn Alongside

- Time & Space complexity details.
- Short description and **fun historical trivia** about each algorithm.
